# Metaflow Learning
## A project to play experiment with Metaflow   
An anomaly detection model is fitted to synthetic two dimensional data. The data includes randomly generated normal and anomalous data by concatenating different distributions.

### Run the experiment
`python metaflow_isolation_forest.py run`

### View the generated experiment data
`python metaflow_isolation_forest.py card view train`
